## Installation

Install the SDK using `npm` or `yarn`.

```bash
npm install @moneytree/mt-link-javascript-sdk

# or

yarn add @moneytree/mt-link-javascript-sdk
```

Then you can use it directly in your code:

<h6>Usage:</h6>

```javascript
// using import
import mtLinkSdk, { MtLinkSdk } from '@moneytree/mt-link-javascript-sdk';

// or using require
const { default: mtLinkSdk, MtLinkSdk } = require('@moneytree/mt-link-javascript-sdk');

// or via window object
const instance = window.mtLinkSdk;
const newInstance = new window.MtLinkSdk();

// mtLinkSdk - an instance of the SDK.
// MtLinkSdk - in case you need to create a new instance of the SDK for whatever reason,
//             e.g: const newInstance = new MtLinkSdk();
```

### Typscript

The source also includes Typescript definition out of the box.

### Polyfills
We use [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) and [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) internally, if you wish to support old browsers (e.g: IE11), make sure to add the necessary polyfills.

## API

SDK offers various APIs below to help from getting guest consent via authorization to exchange for a token to access guest financial data.

### init

SDK initialization method, it is not necessary to call `init` to use some of the APIs.<br /><br />
APIs that requires beforehand `init` call are usually related to OAuth and requires a client id which can only be set via the `init` parameter. These APIs are listed below:
- authorize
- onboard
- exchangeAccessToken
- getAccessTokenInfo

<h6>Usage:</h6>

```javascript
mtLinkSdk.init(clientId, options);
```

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| clientId | string | true | | <p>OAuth `clientId` of the app (please request this from your Moneytree representative if you need one.<p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> SDK will throw an error if non was provided.</p> |
| <span id="api-init_options">options</span> | object | false | | <p>This options includes all the value below and also every `options` parameters of the other APIs, options values passed here during initialization will be used as the default value of other APIs in cases where no value was passed when calling the other APIs.</p><p>The options are [authorize options](#api-authorize_options) and [common options](#common-api-options); refer to each individual links for more details.</p> |
| options.mode | `production`, ` staging`, ` develop`, ` local` | false | `production` | <p>Environment for the SDK to connect to, the SDK will connect to Moneytree production server by default.<li>For Moneytree client, please use `staging` for development as `develop` will contain unstable features.</li><li>`local` should only be used for SDK development as it requires various setup locally.</li></p> |

### authorize

OAuth authorization method to request guest permission to allow data access via [Link API](https://getmoneytree.com/au/link/about).<br /><br />
Guest login are required for this to work, by default we will show the login screen and redirect the guest to the consent screen after they login (Redirection happened immediately if their existing session exists, you can refer [this](#authorize_option_force_logout) option below to force logout an existing guest session).<br /><br />
You can also change to display sign up instead of login screen as default by setting [this](#authorize_option_auth_action) option.

<strong>NOTE:</strong> Please remember to call `init` beforehand.

<h6>Usage:</h6>

```javascript
mtLinkSdk.authorize(options);
```

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| <span id="api-authorize_options">options</span> | object | false | Value set during `init`. | Optional parameters. Includes all options in [common options](#common-api-options). |
| options.scopes | string <p><strong>OR</strong></p> string[] | false | Value set during `init`.<p><strong>OR</strong></p>`guest_read` | Scopes of access permissions, can be one or an array of the below scopes.<br /><br />Currently supported scopes are:<br />`guest_read`, `accounts_read`, `points_read`, `point_transactions_read`, `transactions_read`, `transactions_write`, `expense_claims_read`, `categories_read`, `investment_accounts_read`, `investment_transactions_read`, `notifications_read`, `request_refresh`, `life_insurance_read`. |
| options.redirectUri | string | false | Value set during `init`. | OAuth redirection uri, refer [here](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/redirect-uris/) for more details.<br /><br /><strong>NOTE:</strong> SDK will throw an error if both values here and from the [init options](?id=api-init_options) are undefined. |
| options.state | string | false | Value set during `init`.<p><strong>OR</strong></p>Randomly generated [uuid](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier#Version_4_(random)>). | Refer [here](https://auth0.com/docs/protocols/oauth2/oauth-state) for more details.<br /><br /><strong>NOTE:</strong> Make sure to set this value if your server are generating the value from the server and is redirecting back to your server so that your server can use it to exchange for a token. |
| options.codeVerifier | string | false | Value set during `init`.<p><strong>OR</strong></p>Randomly generated [uuid](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier#Version_4_(random)>). | For [security reasons](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2019/08/22/okta-authjs-pkce#why-you-should-never-use-the-implicit-flow-again) we removed support of using implicit flow instead opting to use [PKCE](https://auth0.com/docs/flows/concepts/auth-code-pkce)/[code grant](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/authorization-code-request/).<p>We only support SHA256, hence this `codeVerifier` will be used to generate the `code_challenge` using SHA256 encoding method. Refer [here](https://auth0.com/docs/api-auth/tutorials/authorization-code-grant-pkce) for more details.</p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Make sure to set this value if your server are generating the value from the server and is redirecting back to your server so that your server can use it to exchange for a token. |
| <span id="authorize_option_force_logout">options.forceLogout</span> | boolean | false | `false` | Force existing guest session to logout and call authorize with a clean state. |
| options.country | `AU`, ` JP` | false | Value set during `init`. | Server location for the guest to login or sign up. If you wish to restrict your guest to only one country, make sure to set this value.<br /><br /><strong>NOTE:</strong> For app created after 2020-07-08, the sign up form will display a country selection dropdown for the guest to choose when this value is undefined or invalid. |

### onboard

Onboard allows a new guest to get onboard faster to use an app without having to go through the registration process. All you have to do is provide an email with all the same configuration as [authorize](#authorize) method options, we will then show them a consent screen explaining all the details, the moment a guest gave their approval, a new Moneytree account will be created on their behalf and authorization is completed. Resulting behavior will be the same as [authorize](#authorize) redirection flow.

Onboard will force all current guest session to logout, hence you do not have to call [logout](#logout) manually to ensure a clean state.

If an account with this email existed, we will redirect the guest to the login screen.

<strong>NOTE:</strong>
<li>Please remember to call `init` beforehand.</li>
<li>For legal reason, you will have to setup your app's terms and condition link to use the onboard feature (please consult your Moneytree representative).</li>

<h6>Usage:</h6>

```javascript
mtLinkSdk.onboard(options)
```

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
| - | - | - | - | - |

### exchangeAccessToken

Since we are using PKCE/Code grant, we will have to exchange the `code` for a token. You can optionally pass `code` via options parameter or it will fallback to automatically extract it from the browser URL.

By default options values for `state`, `codeVerifier` and `onboard` will used the default value from `init`, however if you explicitly passed a new value when calling `authorize` or `onboard` via the options parameter, make sure to reuse the same value when calling this API or else authentication server will throw an error because the values does not matched.

`code` will be invalidated (can be used only once) after exchanged for a token, it is your responsibility to store the token yourself as the SDK do not store it internally.

Refer [here](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/pkce/authorization-code-exchange/) for more details.
